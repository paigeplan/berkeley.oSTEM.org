						<br>information about the event:<br> 

						<br>"A panel of LGBTQ advocates and organizers will talk about the breadth of work being done for LGBTQ communities, and what they believe the advocacy landscape should look like after this summer's US Supreme Court's ruling in favor of same-sex marriage.<br>

						<br>Same-sex marriage is the LGBTQ issue that has received the most media visibility, resources, and overall community attention for over a decade. So much so that after this summer's ruling, many have been left wondering, what else is there to work towards? Others are ready for issues that have been eclipsed by same-sex marriage to finally get the attention they need. The panel will be followed by time for Q&A."<br>
